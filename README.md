# Play as Kairi v0.1
Play as Kairi in Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix. Currently PC only.
Crashes are imminent due to an MDLX Editor bug. Play with caution and save often.

# Features
• Play as Kairi.
    Sora's model has been swapped with Kairi's.
    Sora's name has been replaced with Kairi's in most menus.

# Known Issues
• Random crashing is highly possible due to a bug with MDLX Editor. Models that replace Sora's that exceed his texture count is what causes it.

• Elbow and knee joints bend sharply. This is an issue with Sora's animation itself and nothing to do with Sora's skeleton.

• Kairi's hands are NOT rigged properly. They will stay stiff until they're rigged.

• Kairi's right wrist is completely dislodged. This is either due to Sora's animation or a rigging error. (Sorry.)

• Kairi does NOT have a talking face for cutscenes. She will stare blankly until the proper texture is made.
