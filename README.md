# Play as Kairi v0.2.2

As always, play with caution and save often!


# Features

• Sora's model has been swapped with Kairi's.

• Sora's name has been replaced with Kairi's in most menus.

# Known Issues
**As of v0.2.0:**

• Kairi's hands are very large. Reasons for this are unknown.

• Kairi does NOT have a talking face for cutscenes. She will stare blankly until the proper texture is made.


# NOTES
•If you want to have female battle quotes, I highly recommend @Sai3rina's mod [Female Battle Voice on Nexus.](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomhearts2finalmix/mods/106) It uses [KHPCPatcher](https://github.com/AntonioDePau/KHPCPatchManager/releases).

• HD and optimized textures thanks to @Sai3rina!
