# Play as Kairi v0.2.2
Play as Kairi in Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix. Currently PC only.

As always, play with caution and save often!


# Features
• Play as Kairi.

• Sora's model has been swapped with Kairi's.

• Sora's name has been replaced with Kairi's in most menus.

• Addeed Kairi's Keyblade, Destiny's Embrace, thanks to [Mikote111's Keyblade Generator!](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomhearts2finalmix/mods/129)

• Sora's HUD has been replaceed with an edited version of Kairi's KH2 Illustration!


# Known Issues
**As of v0.2.2:**

• Kairi's hands are very large. Reasons for this are unknown.

• Kairi does NOT have a talking face for cutscenes. She will stare blankly until the proper texture is made.

• Some worlds use a different HUD sprite layout. These worlds currently have the visual glitch: *Space Paranoids*, *Christmas Town*.

# To Do:
• Fix the HUD glitches in *Space Paranoids* and *Christmas Town*

• Create custom outfits for *Halloween Town* and *Christmas Town* based off of Sora's own outfits.

• Use the Kairi model for drive forms.

• Create a Lioness Kairi.

• Create custom outfits for all of the drive forms and the subsequent worlds' drive forms.


# NOTES
•If you want to have female battle quotes, I highly recommend @Sai3rina's mod [Female Battle Voice on Nexus.](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomhearts2finalmix/mods/106) It uses [KHPCPatcher](https://github.com/AntonioDePau/KHPCPatchManager/releases).

• HD and optimized textures thanks to @Sai3rina!
